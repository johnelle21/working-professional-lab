
Secure hash algorithm version one (Sha1)
160 bits
20 bytes  of information 

RESEARCH:
HOW TO INVESTIGATE IN A BASIC FORM TO FIND INFORMATION ON SOMEONES MACHINE

unallocated space 
-space that is marked to be used whether through overwriting or simple addition 

two types of data active and latent 

26 logical drives
3 primary partions
capaity= sector count by sector size 
logic + physical = total 
capacity-total= unaccounted for 

Ntfs - made by microsoft 
research file systems 

data is stored in clusters a cluster is a groups of two or more sectors and is the smallest logical storage 
a sector is the smallest physical storage 512
master boot sector

 f32 cannot hold a file more than 4 gbs 
but it can hold multiple files that ar up to 2tbs 
ntfs -apple doesnt work with it 




size in bytes = cluster size * cluster count 

program

hpfs - mac books 
ext - found on linux

volume serial number is 4 byte value -unique to each value 

ntfs creates a birthdate - where the file was created 

vista and up used documents and settings 
folders that are delted are marked with an X 

bit map keeeps track of cluster allocation 
$I30- tells every file and folder that was in the directory 
page file- used in windows , where windows uses a peice of your memory to store files and which are stored in pages , this isnt need on a nd sSD

due - sunday (wes mantooth exercise)

search for blog  from ppl who use anonymous pipes a dn see what problems they are having with it 
have sumpn like bounded time 
something that helps to alleviate the problem
